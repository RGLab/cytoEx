\usage{
\S4method{gating}{GatingSet,missing}(x, y, ...)

gating.subnode(parent, gs, gating.function = mindensity,
  marker.selection = best.separation, min.count = 1000, min.percent = 0.2,
  debug.mode = FALSE, max.depth = -1, mc.cores = getOption("mc.cores",
  2L), parallel_type = c("multicore", "cluster", "none"), cl = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a GatingSet}

\item{y}{either missing or a character specifying the starting node}

\item{...}{other arguments passed to \link{density} function.}

\item{gating.function}{the 1d gating function used for exhaustive gating}

\item{marker.selection}{a function that selectes the best marker that has the best bi-module separation based on the various peak statistics (e.g. peak area ratio, peak distance, peak/valley ratio, etc...)}

\item{min.count}{the minimum number of cells that allows the gating proceed further}

\item{max.depth}{the maximum depths of gating path. Default is -1, which is no limits.}
}
\description{
The idea is pretty simple: start with the marker with the best separation between -/+ peaks,
then iterate over all other markers until you can't find a good separation between peaks.
Different methods can be used for determining good/bad separation, such as the ICL or the
heuristic method based on peak distance.

\dontrun{
dataDir <- system.file("extdata",package="flowWorkspaceData")
gs <- load_gs(list.files(dataDir, pattern = "gs_manual",full = TRUE))

#clone the gating tree strucuture of the existing manually gated gs(through flowJo)
gs2 <- clone(gs, isNew = FALSE, isEmpty = FALSE)

#erase all the acestor nodes of CD3+
Rm("CD3+", gs2)

# run the exhaustive gating from "singlets" node
gating("singlets", gs2, min.count = 2000, min.percent = 0.3)

# or proceed from any leaf nodes of the existing gating tree
gating(gs2, debug.mode = TRUE) #turn on the debug mode to generate plots and messages (particularly in knitr report) for troubleshooting
